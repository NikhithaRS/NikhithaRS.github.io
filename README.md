## ⚡ About Me
[![Portfolio](https://img.shields.io/badge/🌐_Live_Portfolio-0D0D0D?style=for-the-badge)](https://tinyurl.com/nikhithars-portfoliowebsite)


I’m a **Computer Science undergrad** who blends **UI/UX design, frontend development, and AI** to craft experiences that people *actually* enjoy using.  
My vibe? ✨ Dark mode everything, smooth animations, and just enough flair to make it pop.

Built with ❤️ using **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev)** — an AI-powered web builder that helped bring my vision to life faster than ever.

🖼 **Interactive Project Gallery** – hover, scroll, click, wow  
📱 **Responsive Design** – looks gorgeous on any screen  
🎨 **Micro-interactions** – because details matter
